<h1 style="color:green;">The legendary coach</h1>

<h2>The Special one</h2>
<p>It is rumoured that to become an excellent coach one must be a football prodigy.That is completely not the case with Jose Mou.A student with an eye for success,blinded about by his lustful ambition to rule the footballing world,was acute to detail and uncompromising in his endevaours.Jose a protege,brought up through the ranks of footballing world by the philosopher.Would latter hold the football arena by shackles of his masterclass.He would win all that there was in the soccer arena.That was before he met his greatest nemesis so far.Josep Guardiola,the football genius.And hand in hand they would bout for decades to come.Only one man would triumph in the long quest for the philosophers stone.</p>
<p>After leaving his job as a school coach, Mourinho looked for a path into professional management in his hometown and became youth team coach at Vitória de Setúbal in the early 1990s. Later he accepted the position of assistant manager at Estrela da Amadora,[21] then was a scout at Ovarense. Then, in 1992, an opportunity arose to work as a translator for a top foreign coach: Bobby Robson had been appointed as the new manager of Lisbon club Sporting CP and needed a local coach to work as his interpreter.[19]

Mourinho began discussing tactics and coaching with Robson in his interpreting role.[19] Robson was sacked by the team in December 1993. When Porto appointed him as their head coach, Mourinho moved with him, continuing to coach and interpret for players at the new club.[21] The Porto team, consisting of players like Ljubinko Drulović, Domingos Paciência, Rui Barros, Jorge Costa and Vítor Baía, went on to dominate Portuguese football the following years. With Robson as head coach and Mourinho as his assistant, Porto reached the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, and won the 1993–94 Taça de Portugal, the 1994–95 and 1995–96 Portuguese championship, and the 1994, 1995 and 1996 Portuguese Super Cup, the latter with a 5–0 victory over arch-rivals Benfica, in what proved to be Robson's last game at Porto before moving to Barcelona, earning Robson the nickname "Bobby Five-O" in Portugal. Such was the impact of Robson and Mourinho on making Porto a lasting team, that the club managed to claim three more consecutive championships after they had left.

After two years at Porto the duo moved again, switching to Barcelona in 1996.[22] Mourinho and his family moved to the city of Barcelona, and he gradually became a prominent figure of the club's staff by translating at press conferences, planning practice sessions and helping players through tactical advice and analyses of the opposition. Robson and Mourinho's styles complemented each other: the Englishman favoured an attacking style, while Mourinho covered defensive options, and the Portuguese's love of planning and training combined with Robson's direct man-management. The partnership was fruitful and Barcelona finished the season by winning the European Cup Winners' Cup. Robson moved club the following season but this time Mourinho did not follow as Barcelona were keen to retain him as assistant manager</p>
