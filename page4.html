<p>Jose Mourinho will be officially unveiled as United's new manager next month

Manchester United will officially unveil Jose Mourinho as their new manager in July - and one of the topics he will be pressed on is his devotion to developing youth players.

The Special One has gained a reputation for failing to give youngsters a chance during his managerial career, with critics claiming he can only work for clubs with big transfer budgets.

However, a comment made by Mouriho when he returned from Real Madrid for his second stint in charge of Chelsea in 2013 suggests his eagerness to nurture youngsters has heightened, the Manchester Evening News report.

“I'm curious to see how youth football in England is now structured, and I'll have to smell it,” he said three years ago.

“I need to understand how the competition is working because, for example, in Spain my kid (José Mario, who has since joined Fulham), even when he was only 10, was playing in a championship of 16 teams, so 30 official matches in the league all against the best teams in Madrid.</p>
